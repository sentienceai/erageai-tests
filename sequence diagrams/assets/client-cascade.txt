BLE Scanner-->BLECoordinator: return discovered devices
destroy BLE Scanner

// Store Servers on startup
BLECoordinator->*ServerWebservice: Call store request, passing queue

ServerWebservice->HttpManager: Call post request

HttpManager ->]: POST /measurement/store HTTP/1.1

destroy HttpManager

ServerWebservice-->BLECoordinator: Initiate RSSI Collection in loop above
destroy ServerWebservice

loop Collect RSSI for 500ms
[<-BLECoordinator: Connect to devices, get data
[-->BLECoordinator: Get RSSI of response
note right of BLECoordinator:Store Measurement in Queue
end

note over BLECoordinator: Stop Scanner to free up memory\nand stop BTC task

BLECoordinator->*MeasurementWebservice: Call store request, passing queue
destroy BLECoordinator
note over MeasurementWebservice:Convert queue to JSON request Body
